# financial-fraud-detection
Developed and evaluated machine learning models—XGBoost, Random Forest, and a Neural Network—for detecting fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced financial dataset. Tackled key challenges such as extreme class imbalance and high false positive rates by applying oversampling (SMOTE), under-sampling, and cost-sensitive learning. Focused on improving recall while minimizing false positives. Also explored baseline models and advanced techniques like threshold tuning to strengthen model performance and adaptability to evolving fraud patterns.
